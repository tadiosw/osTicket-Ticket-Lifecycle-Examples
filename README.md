<h1>osTicket - Lifecycle Examples Setup</h1>

<p>This tutorial demonstrates how to create and manage tickets as an end user.</p>

<p>Ken is submitting a ticket under the help topic "Business Critical Outage" due to reports from customers who are unable to access mobile banking.</p>

<p>Agents can view active tickets in the agent panel. Queue managers are responsible for assigning priority tickets to the appropriate agents and ensuring they are linked to the correct SLA plans.</p>

<br />

<p>In this example, the priority level of the ticket is being set. Since the issue impacts a critical part of the business, the priority is changed to "Emergency." The SLA plan is adjusted accordingly, and the ticket is assigned to a top-level technician. In some ticketing systems, customers may have the ability to set their own SLA plans.</p>
